# Bioinformatics

## Description

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computation, and statistics to analyse and interpret biological data. With the growing availability of high-quality biological data, bioinformatics has become an essential tool to understand biological processes.

However, for the results of bioinformatics analyses to be reliable and replicable, it is necessary to guarantee the reproducibility of the process. Reproducibility means that other researchers should be able to reproduce the same results using the same data and the same techniques.

A lack of reproducibility is a common problem with bioinformatics research. Often, researchers use personalised tools and techniques, which makes it difficult for other researchers to reproduce the results. Furthermore, many researchers do not provide sufficient information about the data and the analysis methods. 

Reproducibility is fundamental to the validity and the transparency of bioinformatics research. Without reproducibility, the results can be questioned and the reliability of the research can be impaired. Furthermore, a lack of reproducibility can lead to a waste of time and resources, as researchers can end up redoing experiments that were already done.

To guarantee the reproducibility of bioinformatics research, it is important to follow good practices and standards established by the scientific community. These good practices include documenting all the analysis steps, including software versions and libraries used, providing detailed information about the data, and sharing the code and the data used in the analysis.

In summary, reproduciblity is crucial for bioinformatics research because it guarantees the validity and the transparency of the results. To attain reproducibility, it is important to follow good practices and standards established by the scientific community.

This repository is intended to help bioinformatics researchers in Brazil and beyond.
